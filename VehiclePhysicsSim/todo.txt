---TODO---
----------CURRENTLY WORKING ON----------
* Fix the cars position forcing when it goes over a ramp
----------------------------------------


* Look into variable surface types returning variable coefficients of friction on the terrain.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 'Integrate' the car model into the foggy, variably-lit environment. Pass the sun direction and fog params
  to the car's shader so that it also disappears into the fog with the terrain etc

* Using the FLAT_PLANE in the EnvironmentModel, look at why updating the data in an IndexBuffer causes problems.
  See line 334 of DebugCarModel. This section simply tries to update the data in the car's base index buffer (it
  just copies the existing indices and so doesn't really even update anything) and for some reason, the index buffer
  of the FLAT_PLANE in the EnvironmentModel is affected! Why is this happening?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* More in depth wheel/tire physics (if time permits)
  - Rolling radius vs loaded radius
