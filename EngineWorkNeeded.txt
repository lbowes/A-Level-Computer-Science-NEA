----------Engine modifications that need to be made at home----------

* Add more descriptive error messages for obj model loading problems. At the moment, if the vertices are all on
  one line, the engine tries to convert 'v' to an integer and throws an exception with no message. Make it clear
  why errors are being generated with some formatting checks.

* Add more descriptive error messages for occasions where shaders are created, but do not have the standard uniforms
  added. Each shader that is made, has to have the default uniforms added to it in order to be able to render anything.
  If this is not done, then any calls to render an object using the shader will produce a crash, but the programmer
  is not told anything.

* Consider adding a `makeFullScreen()` member function for `Window`. This could make use of the complete opengl 
  fullscreen mode (no windows UI). When this is done, it should be easy to add the option for a `Application` (and 
  `Window` in `Application` constructor) to be created with fullscreen as a default. This will be much easier with 
  DEFAULT ARGUMENTS for both `Window` and `Application`.

* For `Physics::Spring`, either add a `double getRestLength()` member, or a `void resetToRest()` member function
  that simply sets the length to the rest length, meaning that - unless updated afterwards - the spring will no
  longer generate any force.
